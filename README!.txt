Welcome to the Friend Tutorial!
Prerequesites: None

Inside Ranger.h, you'll see we create "class Ranger", which is 
a child of "character". You'll also see in this clsas, we have
"friend class Wizard";

Here we have a friend class declaration.
This makes it so that the Wizard class can access any private members of the Ranger class.
See enchantarrows function in wizard to see it at work.
Also, notice that wizard doesn't need to be defined yet to do this.
This will even automatically forward-declare our wizard class if it hasn't been declared!
